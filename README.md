## Work Experience
**Data Scientist Intern @ NBCUniversal (_Jun 2024 - Sep 2024_)**
- Developed and deployed a research-based hierarchical model with Spark, reducing forecast error by 14% and improving RÂ² by 19% across 11 digital platforms, enabling more accurate financial planning.
- Extended granularity and stability of production models by designing custom filtering and detrending mechanisms. Reduced validation error from 40% to 28% and increased forecast reliability for volatile revenue streams.

**Data Analytics Intern @ Urban Science (_May 2023 - Aug 2023_)**
- Collaborated with a cross-functional team to deliver machine learning solutions for consulting clients, including Volkswagen, addressing business needs in customer retention and after-sales service.
- Applied machine learning to predict user purchase behavior and identify high-risk churn segments, enabling targeted service strategies and improving customer retention.
  
**Quantitative Strategy Intern @ Haitong Securities (_Aug 2022 - Dec2022_)**
- Engineered 12 key financial ratios and developed an ensemble of 4 deep reinforcement learning agents, enhancing risk assessment and guiding high-value investment decisions.
- Applied sliding-window validation to stabilize returns and mitigate overfitting; selected agents achieved Sharpe ratios 29% above baseline on Dow Jones stocks.
  
**AI & Data Science Intern @ Fosun (_May 2021 - Jun 2022_)**
- Developed custom Gradient Boosting and neural network models for glucose prediction using PPG data, achieving 0.6 RMSE for non-diabetics and 1.4 RMSE for diabetic patients, contributing to non-invasive healthcare innovation.
- Optimized training data pools with clustering to boost model generalizability across user profiles. Improved new user prediction accuracy by 23% by building tailored customer segmentation models, driving personalized healthcare strategies.

## Projects
### Enhancing rare object detection in vision tasks
Developed novel Out-of-Distribution detection pipeline with a dynamic memory buffer, achieving a 47% increase in true positive rate (22%) for rare object identification in autonomous driving datasets, enhancing balanced representation learning. Improved model training with regard to the important long tail distribution.

### Investigating parameter budget in NLP
Conducted ablation study on a state-of-the-art mixture of Adapter method (MAM), reducing parameter size by 90% while enhancing model performance by 3.6% on SuperGLUE tasks.
Identified different optimal parameter allocation ratios across 5 ratio candidates, 4 tasks, and 3 budget levels on SuperGLUE benchmarks, highlighting the need for task-specific, budget-aware optimization for pre-trained NLP models.

### Fairness enhanced recommendation system
Implemented CF-based neural networks with regularization and embedding debiasing. With implicit feedback training, the fairness metric improved by 43% to 55% for different subgroup measures and the system maintained the original level of performance. Below are vector projections before and after debiasing.

### Identification of hish-risk patients in procedure continuation
Perform data cleaning and feature engineer on raw medical and pharmacy records. Built ensemble models and further improved AUC by 14% with a stacking meta model. Fairness adjusted AUC score ranked top 20% of more than 200 participating teams.
